# Hospital-Management-System

Overview:


The Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed to streamline the operations of a hospital or healthcare facility. It aims to efficiently manage patient information, doctor schedules, appointments, billing, and other administrative functions. The system will leverage data structures to handle data efficiently, ensuring quick access, manipulation, and storage.
This project provides an excellent opportunity to implement and understand real-world applications of data structures while solving critical operational challenges in healthcare.

Project problem:

Hospitals often struggle with managing vast amounts of data related to patients, doctors, and staff. Scheduling appointments without conflicts, keeping track of medical inventory, and ensuring accurate billing can be overwhelming. Delays in accessing or updating records often lead to inefficiencies, affecting the quality of care and administrative operations. 

Project solution:

The Hospital Management System addresses these challenges by utilizing efficient data structures like linked lists. These structures enable quick data retrieval, automate appointment scheduling to avoid conflicts, and simplify inventory tracking and billing. By streamlining these processes, the system reduces delays, enhances organization, and improves overall hospital operations and patient care.

Solution justification:

The Hospital Management System ensures efficient handling of complex hospital operations by using structures that optimize data storage and retrieval. This approach streamlines processes like scheduling, record management, and inventory tracking, resulting in faster workflows, reduced errors, and improved overall efficiency for both staff and patients.
